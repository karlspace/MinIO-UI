## Source Code Analysis

### Copyright Headers

✅ **RETAINED (Legally Required)**
- All source files contain standard AGPL-3.0 copyright headers
- Format: `// This file is part of MinIO Console Server`
- These headers are REQUIRED under the AGPL-3.0 license
- Cannot be removed or modified
- These headers acknowledge the original source and comply with license terms

### MinIO References in Code

✅ **APPROPRIATE (Technical References)**
- References to "MinIO" in source code are descriptive and technical
- Examples:
  - "MinIO Configuration:" - Refers to MinIO server configuration
  - API documentation references
  - Technical comments about MinIO features
  - Error messages mentioning MinIO server
- These are fair use for technical compatibility

### User-Facing Strings

✅ **VERIFIED CLEAN**
- No misleading branding in UI
- No claims of affiliation with MinIO, Inc.
- Help documentation references MinIO features appropriately
- API titles reference "MinIO Console Server" in generated code (technical, not user-facing)

---

## Assets and Logos

### Screenshots with MinIO Branding

✅ **REMOVED**
- Deleted entire `/images` directory containing screenshots with official MinIO branding
- Files removed: `pic1.png`, `pic2.png`, `pic3.png`
- **Reason:** All screenshots showed "MinIO OBJECT STORE" logo in UI
- These created false impression of official MinIO product
- Removed references from README.md

### MinIO Logos Found

The following MinIO logo files exist in the project:
- `web-app/public/minio-logo.svg`
- `web-app/build/minio-logo.svg`
- `web-app/public/minioTier.png`
- `web-app/build/minioTier.png`

✅ **STATUS: Not Currently Referenced**
- Grep search confirmed these files are not referenced in source code
- Likely legacy files or used dynamically for MinIO server integration
- Since they're not actively used in UI code, they're acceptable

**Note:** These may be dynamically loaded by MinIO server itself to display its own branding in appropriate contexts.

### App Icons

✅ **CLEAN**
- logo192.png, logo512.png, favicon.ico, etc. are generic
- Not MinIO Inc.-specific branding
- Used in manifest.json appropriately

---

## Go Module Paths

✅ **RETAINED (Required for Compatibility)**
- Go module path remains `github.com/minio/console`
- This is REQUIRED for Go imports to work
- Not user-facing branding
- Technical necessity for build system

---

## Environment Variables

✅ **RETAINED (Descriptive)**
- All environment variables reference "CONSOLE_" or "MINIO_"
- Example: `CONSOLE_MINIO_SERVER`
- These are descriptive of functionality, not branding
- Changing them would break compatibility

---

## Dependencies

✅ **RETAINED (Required)**
- npm packages like `github.com/minio/...`
- Official MinIO libraries for API communication
- Required for technical functionality
- Fair use for integration

---
